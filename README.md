# ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!

- JavaScript/TypeScript, the go-to wizard for web sorcery and bug extermination.
- Aspiring PHP padawan, dreaming of buying a Lambo with my future PHP skills. Dream big or go home, right? 
- Rust explorer, navigating uncharted territories in pursuit of mastery.
- Proudly rejecting the comfort of IDEs, I use VIM by the way.
